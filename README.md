# DataConveyer_SavedConfig

DataConveyer_SavedConfig solution demonstrates ability to save and
restore Data Conveyer configuration. The configuration is named
TimeZones and consists of TimeZones.cfg and TimeZones.dll files.

The functionality inside TimeZones.dll calclulates the US time
zone based on the US state. This functionality is used in two
projects: one project adds the time zone to each person in the
input list and the other project splits the list of people by the
time zone.

## Contents Summary

* Config folder with 2 projects to create TimeZones configuration data:

  - ConfigCreator - will create TimeZones.cfg file upon execution.

  - TimeZones     - will create TimeZones.dll file upon Build.

* IncludeTimeZone folder containing first of the 2 projects that use TimeZones
configuration. Upon execution, will create output_with_time_zone.csv file.

* SplitByTimeZone folder containing second of the 2 projets that use TimeZones
configuration. Upon execution will create 6 output_...csv files (one per time zone).

* Common folder containing data shared between projects.
Subfolders of the Common folder:

  - ConfigData folder intended to contain saved configuration data named TimeZones, i.e. the results from the two projects located in the Config folder.

    + TimeZones.cfg is the XML configuration data created by executing ConfigCreator project.

    + TimeZones.dll is the build target of the TimeZones project (copied via post-build event).

  - Input folder that constitutes input location for the two projects located in the main folder, i.e. IncludeTimeZone and SplitByTimeZone (note that both projects use the TimeZones configuration from the ConfigData folder). A sample input file (input.csv) is included.

  - Output folder that constitutes output destination for files produced by the two projects located in the main folder, i.e. IncludeTimeZone and SplitByTimeZone.
